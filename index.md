> VTubing doesn't have to be hard. You just need to get started.

## Mission

{: .note }
This guide is currently extremely WIP as I gather my thoughts and resources. Expect the content and overall structure to change drastically between updates.

What this page will try to do is provide the most straightforward path from knowing absolutely nothing about streaming to your first broadcast, regardless of your technical knowledge or experience.

I try to go through each recommended website and resource to (1) make sure they are as straightforward as possible and not overwhelming or (2) summarize and simplify them so they can be more easily understood.

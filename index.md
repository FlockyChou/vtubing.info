## Mission

{: .note }
This guide is currently extremely WIP as I gather my thoughts and resources, and determine the overall structure.

What this guide will try to do is provide the most straightforward path from knowing absolutely nothing about streaming to your first broadcast, regardless of your technical knowledge or experience.

I have personally gone through each recommended website and resource in order to either (1) make sure they are as straightforward as possible and not overwhelming or (2) summarize and simplify them so they can be more easily understood.

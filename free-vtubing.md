## Free Models

### Free PNGTuber Creators

{: .important }
Please note that while these are free to use, **all Picrews used for PNGtuber creation must be credited via a link to the Picrew's artist.** Additionally, if you plan on using the design of your Picrew PNGTuber as the base for a L2D or 3D model down the line, please be aware that that Picrew's artist may hold some copyright over elements of the character and that it's best to reach out to them before proceeding.

Picrew is a site that hosts user-created character creators, usually used for avatars. However, most are usually not marked for commercial use and some explicitly forbid them being used as a PNGTuber.

However, artist VTuber Squiiji created [Iiji's PNGTuber Picrew Masterlist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xuLykMNFDOj_7cRN09Suqf0wecZ1VufzN9OEY9PDkzg), a massive list of Picrews that can be used for PNGTubing. This list has over 100 different Picrews from different artists and art styles ranging from anime, western, chibi, to furry so there's a pretty good chance you'll find something that fits what you're looking for.

In the image above showcasing [TsuruDraws' Picrew](https://picrew.me/en/image_maker/2304839), you can see how easy it is to create and customize your own PNGTuber using Picrew. **However, please read the rules for each Picrew carefully.** While this one does allow for use as a PNGTuber, it **forbids commercial use** ("You may NOT use this for business accounts, merch, advertising, etc.").

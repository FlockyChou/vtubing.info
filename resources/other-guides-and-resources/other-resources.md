## Guides

### Streamlabs

{: .note }
I'm personally [not a fan of Streamlabs as a company](https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/obs-streamlabs-reach-agreement-plagiarism-controversy-1727742/) but their guides can be helpful.

Streamlabs has a series of guides starting with [VTubing for Beginners guide](https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/vtubing-for-beginners). These can be informative and I've even featured some of their guides as recommended reading in mine; however, I feel like some of the are very verbose info dumps and give too many options. While the same topics are covered sometimes, the main goal of my guides are to take a lot of the guesswork out of the equation and get people started, with the option to change their mind on things later.

Additionally, there are quite a few guides from Streamlabs with [no real way way to see all of them in one place based on relevance](https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/search?query=VTuber&categories=streaming%2Cplatforms%2Cstreamlabs-desktop%2Ctools%2Cwidgets%2Csupport%2Cuniversity).

## Resources

### VTResources
[VTResources](https://vtresources.carrd.co/) is a page that has a **huge** amount of resources. If you're just looking for a vast amount of VTubing resources, this would be the place to go.

VTResources was actually one of the inspirations behind me making my own guide. I saw the value in something like it but felt like it was a bit too overwhelming for someone just starting out with no idea on what's what.

> VTubing doesn't have to be hard. You just need to get started.

[Read the guide here](https://vtubing.info/).

This guide is using the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme.

# Background
As I transitioned from solely watching corporate VTubers to watching more indie VTubers, I've noticed a number of people talk about not knowing anything when they started and fighting an uphill battle to get things working, not having any sort of reliable tech support, struggling to figure out how to set up OBS, etc. As someone who has had (very) minor success streaming and building a small community, and has worked in tech support, I was hoping I could contribute something to this space.

# Mission
What this guide will try to do is provide the most straightforward path from knowing absolutely nothing about streaming to your first broadcast, regardless of your technical knowledge or experience.

I have personally gone through each recommended website and resource in order to either (1) make sure they are as straightforward as possible and not overwhelming or (2) summarize and simplify them so they can be more easily understood.

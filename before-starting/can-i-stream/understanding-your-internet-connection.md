## Summary

Your internet connection will greatly affect the quality of your stream and if you're able to even stream at all.

This section will go over what what the minimum internet speed requirements are needed for each of the streaming platforms and how to interpret them.

## What Internet Speed Do I Need for Streaming?

While you may have a decent internet connection for watching YouTube or Netflix, the **most important number when it comes to streaming is upload speed**. Be aware that while you may have good download speeds, you might not have the same upload speed. Some ISPs, especially in more rural areas that utilize satellite internet, may have **significantly less upload speed**. Additionally, if there are multiple people living in your household or have multiple devices that are connected to the internet, you may need higher internet speeds/bandwidth to stream effectively.

Below, you can find the recommended bitrates for multiple platforms. Your internet speed **should have at least 50% MORE upload speed than your bitrate setting.** For example, if you are doing 6,000 Kbps, you should have at least 6,000 Kbps + 3,000 Kbps (50% of 6,000) = 9,000 Kbps upload. 

In order to stream at 1080p at 60fps:

| Platform | Min Bitrate | Max Bitrate | Upload Speed Recommendation |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| [YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2853702?hl=en) | 4 Mbps | 12 Mbps | 6-18 Mbps |
| [Twitch](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/broadcasting-guidelines?language=en_US) | 6,000 kbps or 6 Mbps | - | 9 Mbps |
| [Kick](https://help.kick.com/en/articles/7066931-how-to-stream-on-kick-com) | 1,000 kbps or 1 Mbps | 8,000 kbps or 8 Mbps | 1.5-12 Mbps
| [Facebook Live]() | 4,500 kbps or 4.5 Mbps | 9,000 kbps or 9 Mbps| 7-14 Mbps |

If your upload speed is anywhere between the min/max bitrates listed, you can calculate your own custom bitrate using [a bitrate calculator](https://bitratecalc.com/) to try to find your own sweet spot between quality and bandwidth.

## Mbps? mbps?

Typically, your internet speed is measured in Mbps (megabits per second). **This is different from mbps (megabytes per second)**, with megabytes being commonly known as the unit used to display how big a file is on your phone or computer. **This is purposefully deceptive marketing** to make it look like you are getting more than what you're paying for and makes calculating speed a bit annoying as 8 megabits (Mb) = 1 megabyte (MB).

This also means that, in theory:

| Download Speed | 1 MB | 100 MB | 1 GB | 100 GB |
| -------------- | ---- | ------ | ---- | ------ |
| 100 Mbps | 0.08 secs | 8 secs | 1 min 20 secs | 2 hrs 13 secs |
| 1 Gbpm ("gigabit") | 0.008 secs | 0.8 secs | 8 secs | 13 mins  20 secs|

You can learn more about the difference and calculate download times using [this Omni Calculator for Download Time](https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/download-time).

## How Do I Check My Internet Speed?

The easiest way to check your internet speed is to use [Speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/), [Fast.com](https://fast.com/), or simply [Google "internet speed test"](https://www.google.com/search?q=internet+speed+test).

## What If I Don't Meet The Minimum Requirements?

The speed and quality if your internet service varies greatly [depending on which part of the world you live in](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index).

According to Speedtest.net, [most Americans should meet these upload requirements](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/united-states?fixed#market-analysis); however, that also means there is a percentage of people who don't.

[The average cost for 25 Mbps internet is $35/mo and 100 Mbps internet is $62/mo](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/internet/internet-cost-per-month/) but prices can vary wildly based on the type of internet and Internet Service Provider (ISP). As stated above, in more rural areas where satellite internet is more widely used, you may have to pay more for lower-quality service. Additionally, some apartment complexes, neighborhoods, and even whole states have ISP monopolies that may result you paying higher prices for lower speeds.

The short of it is check what providers are available in your area and see if fiber optic internet is available. If the quality of the internet is poor in your area, there isn't much else you can do.

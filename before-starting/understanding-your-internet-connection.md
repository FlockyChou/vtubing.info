## Summary

Your internet connection will greatly affect the quality of your stream and if you're able to even stream at all.

This section will go over what what the minimum internet speed requirements are needed for each of the streaming platforms and how to interpret them.

## What Internet Speed Do I Need for Streaming?

{: .important }
Be aware that while you may have good download speeds, you might not have the same upload speed. Some ISPs, especially in more rural areas that utilize satellite internet, may have significantly less upload speed.

While you may have a decent internet connection for watching YouTube or Netflix, the **most important number when it comes to streaming is upload speed**. Additionally, if you are multiple people living in your household or have multiple devices that are connected to the internet, you may need higher internet speeds/bandwidth.

Below, you can find the recommended bitrates for multiple platforms. Your internet speed **should have at least 50% MORE upload speed than your bitrate setting.** For example, if you are doing 6,000 Kbps, you should have at least 6,000 Kbps + 3,000 Kbps (50% of 6,000) = 9,000 Kbps upload. 

In order to stream at 1080p at 60fps:

| Platform | Min Bitrate | Max Bitrate | Upload Speed Recommendation |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| [YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2853702?hl=en) | 4 Mbps | 12 Mbps | 6-18 Mbps |
| [Twitch](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/broadcasting-guidelines?language=en_US) | 6,000 kbps or 6 Mbps | - | 9 Mbps |
| [Kick](https://help.kick.com/en/articles/7066931-how-to-stream-on-kick-com) | 1,000 kbps or 1 Mbps | 8,000 kbps or 8 Mbps | 1.5-12 Mbps
| [Facebook Live]() | 4,500 kbps or 4.5 Mbps | 9,000 kbps or 9 Mbps| 7-14 Mbps |

You can calculate your own custom bitrate using [a bitrate calculator](https://bitratecalc.com/) to better suit your internet speeds.

## Mbps? mbps?

Typically, your internet speed is measured in Mbps (megabits per second). **This is different from mbps (megabytes per second)**, with megabytes being commonly known as the unit used to display how big a file is on your phone or computer. **This is purposefully deceptive marketing** to make it look like you are getting more than what you're paying for and makes calculating speed a bit annoying as 8 megabits (Mb) = 1 megabyte (MB).

This also means that, in theory:

| Download Speed | 1 MB | 100 MB | 1 GB | 100 GB |
| -------------- | ---- | ------ | ---- | ------ |
| 100 Mbps | 0.08 secs | 8 secs | 1 min 20 secs | 2 hrs 13 secs |
| 1 Gbpm ("gigabit") | 0.008 secs | 0.8 secs | 8 secs | 13 mins  20 secs|

## How Do I Check My Internet Speed?

{: .note }
> The speed and quality if your internet service varies greatly [depending on where you live](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index).
> 
> In the United States, [the average cost for 25 Mbps internet is $35/mo and 100 Mbps internet is $62/mo](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/internet/internet-cost-per-month/). However, that doesn't always mean that's the price you're going to pay. Some apartment complexes and even whole states have ISP monopolies that may result you paying higher prices for lower speeds.

The easiest way to check your internet speed is to use [Speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/), [Fast.com](https://fast.com/), or simply [Google "internet speed test"](https://www.google.com/search?q=internet+speed+test).
